ðŸ‘‹ Hey wsg, it's Daliah :)

A little about what I'm interested in is learning to code websites, web apps and iOS apps.

As for the moment I am currently learning basic syntax for coding websites. Going simple.
Iâ€™m not really looking to collaborate at the moment for the fact I am still in a learning process ðŸ˜… Although, I wouldn't mind a helping hand :).

ðŸ“« If for any reason you would like to reach me, you may contact me at: lilidiaz@protonmail.com

p.s. I'm pretty friendly so no need to be afraid :P
